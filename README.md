# Hospital-Simulation
My DSA Project 
This project will accept some patients and schedules them based on three methods:
  1-First come first serve algorithm
  2-Shortest job first algorithm
  3-Priority scheduling algorithm

The program accepts input patients through directly entering each patients properties
or via a text file that should be stored in the program directory.

The output will be shown on the console after each time unit is passed.
